## Coding Patterns

### Error Handling
[Auto-extracted from codebase - how errors are caught and handled]

Example:
```
[Code pattern 1 showing typical error handling]
```

### Async/Concurrency Pattern
[How asynchronous operations are managed - callbacks, promises, async-await, etc.]

Example:
```
[Code pattern 2]
```

### State Management
[How application state is tracked and updated]

Example:
```
[Code pattern 3]
```

### Data Validation
[How inputs and data are validated before use]

Example:
```
[Code pattern 4]
```

## Architectural Patterns

### Module Organization
[How code is organized - by feature, by type, monolithic, microservices]

Pattern:
```
[Directory structure showing pattern]
```

### API Design
[RESTful, GraphQL, RPC, or other API patterns]

Example endpoints/queries:
```
[Pattern examples]
```

### Dependency Injection
[How dependencies are managed - constructor injection, service locator, etc.]

### Communication Patterns
[Message passing, pub-sub, events, direct calls]

## Testing Patterns

### Unit Test Structure
[How unit tests are organized and named]

Example:
```
[Test pattern]
```

### Integration Test Approach
[How components are tested together]

### Test Coverage Areas
[What is tested, what is not, rationale]

### Mock/Stub Strategy
[How external dependencies are mocked in tests]

## Performance Patterns

### Caching Strategy
[How caching is implemented - in-memory, distributed, TTL-based]

### Data Fetching
[Lazy loading, eager loading, pagination patterns]

### Resource Management
[Connection pooling, memory management, cleanup]

## Security Patterns

### Authentication/Authorization
[How identity verification and permissions are handled]

### Secret Management
[How sensitive data is stored and accessed]

### Input Sanitization
[How user inputs are validated and escaped]

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Known Issues
- **Anti-pattern**: [What to avoid]
  - Why: [Why it's problematic]
  - Alternative: [Correct pattern]

### Common Mistakes
- **Mistake**: [Specific pitfall observed]
  - Context: [When/why it happens]
  - Prevention: [How to avoid]
