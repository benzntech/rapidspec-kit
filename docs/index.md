# RapidRapidSpec-Kit

*Build high-quality software faster with complete automation.*

**RapidRapidSpec-Kit is a comprehensive fork of RapidSpec-Kit with 100% RapidSpec automation parity. A complete 9-phase automation system that allows organizations to focus on product scenarios rather than writing undifferentiated code, powered by AI-driven development workflows.**

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development **flips the script** on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: **specifications become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

## Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](installation.md)

- [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)

- [Upgrade Guide](upgrade.md)

- [Local Development](local-development.md)

## Core Philosophy

Spec-Driven Development is a structured process that emphasizes:

- **Intent-driven development** where specifications define the "*what*" before the "*how*"

- **Rich specification creation** using guardrails and organizational principles

- **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot code generation from prompts

- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI model capabilities for specification interpretation

## Development Phases

| Phase   | Focus   | Key Activities   |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------- |

| **0-to-1 Development** ("Greenfield") | Generate from scratch | <ul><li>Start with high-level requirements</li><li>Generate specifications</li><li>Plan implementation steps</li><li>Build production-ready applications</li></ul> |

| **Creative Exploration** | Parallel implementations | <ul><li>Explore diverse solutions</li><li>Support multiple technology stacks & architectures</li><li>Experiment with UX patterns</li></ul> |

| **Iterative Enhancement** ("Brownfield") | Brownfield modernization | <ul><li>Add features iteratively</li><li>Modernize legacy systems</li><li>Adapt processes</li></ul> |

## Experimental Goals

Our research and experimentation focus on:

### Technology Independence

- Create applications using diverse technology stacks

- Validate the hypothesis that Spec-Driven Development is a process not tied to specific technologies, programming languages, or frameworks

### Enterprise Constraints

- Demonstrate mission-critical application development

- Incorporate organizational constraints (cloud providers, tech stacks, engineering practices)

- Support enterprise design systems and compliance requirements

### User-Centric Development

- Build applications for different user cohorts and preferences

- Support various development approaches (from vibe-coding to AI-native development)

### Creative & Iterative Processes

- Validate the concept of parallel implementation exploration

- Provide robust iterative feature development workflows

- Extend processes to handle upgrades and modernization tasks

## The 9-Phase Automation Workflow

RapidRapidSpec-Kit implements a complete automated workflow across 9 phases:

1. **Specification** - Define what you want to build

2. **Research** - Conduct web research for technical decisions

3. **Verification** - Verify existing code and frameworks

4. **Options** - Generate multiple implementation approaches

5. **Planning** - Create technical plans and task lists

6. **Application** - Apply code with checkpoint approvals

7. **Review** - Multi-agent quality review

8. **Commits** - Auto-generate conventional commits and PRs

9. **Archive** - Archive and deploy completed features

See the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md) for a complete walkthrough.
